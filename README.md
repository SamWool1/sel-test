# Sel-Test
Old work project with all of the work-specific stuff removed. Primary use is running suites of tests (usually Selenium) and generating HTML pages that display the results of and information on those tests.
Uploaded here for portfolio purposes. Will update the README properly if work continues on it.

The name was originally intended to only be a placeholder, since this project was initially concieved as a way to get my feet wet with Selenium WebDriver, but I ended up making enough progress that I decided to keep it. If work ever continues on this as a personal project, the name will probably have to change.
